A Personal Website Built with Next.js and Firebase. This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

The `r0yce.com` website leverages Next.js to serve MDX content in a flexible environment, supporting both static site generation and on-demand server rendering. The application tracks content for each page, including projects, blog posts, and other resources, using MDX files to store metadata and content.

It also includes a realtime text editor for collaborative editing, built with Firebase. To access the editor, visit the `src/app/(app)/kanjou` route on the website.
