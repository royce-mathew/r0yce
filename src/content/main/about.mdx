### Cloud Developer
As a Cloud Developer, I developed and managed an internal application that handles various SQL database read and write operations.

I also implemented a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the application to the cloud. This pipeline saved the company several hundred hours of manual deployment time. To handle varying demand and load, I implemented various features such as load balancing, auto-scaling, and containerization.

To accommodate multiple applications with different functionalities and requirements, I designed the website using a microservices architecture and a RESTful API.

### Game Development Career

I have worked on multiple games utilizing the ROBLOX engine. One of my commissions were on the game known as [Project Star](https://www.roblox.com/games/6573910231/Project-Star) which has over 20 Million player visits.
