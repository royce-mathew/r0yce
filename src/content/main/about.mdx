# About Me

Hi, I'm Royce Mathew - A passionate software developer in my fourth year at Ontario Tech University.

I love building things with code, whether that's experimenting in my free time, contributing to open source, or taking on new technical challenges. I started out developing games on the **ROBLOX Engine**, where I've been creating and programming for over five years, and have since expanded into areas like web development, cloud infrastructure, and low-level systems programming.

# Career

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work across multiple domains of Computer Science - including **Web Development, Game Development, Neural Networks, and Low-Level Programming**. Each experience has helped me build a strong foundation in problem-solving and adaptability.
