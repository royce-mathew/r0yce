This project was a **first-person survival horror game** developed in `Lua-U` on
the Roblox Engine. Inspired by classics such as _Resident Evil_ and _PT_, the
game focuses on atmosphere, tension, and engaging gameplay.

As the **sole programmer**, I collaborated closely with modelers, builders, and designers to bring the project to life. My role involved implementing the game&apos;s core systems, ensuring smooth mechanics, and creating an immersive horror experience. The game is currently in its final stages of development.

## Learning Experience

- Designed and implemented a **client-server architecture** to handle game logic and user interactions.
- Built a **responsive inventory system** with an intuitive graphical interface.
- Developed a **dynamic lighting system** to reinforce the eerie, horror-driven atmosphere.
- Created a **database system** to manage player data, progress, and user settings.
- Scripted **game events** to deliver challenging and unpredictable scenarios.

# Features

## Database and Inventory System

### How it works

The database system is built as a wrapper around loleris&apos;s [ProfileStore](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileStore), a periodic DataStore saving solution with session locking.

The system tracks player progress, positions, settings, and inventory in different tables and distributes them across different scripts with a centralized state manager. Data can be saved automatically or manually, depending on user preference. The system was developed with an interactive GUI which allows players to click items and inspect them in 3d space using `ViewportFrames`.

### Internals

- As the player joins, the game checks for an existing database entry and loads the player's progress; new players are automatically assigned a new entry.
- The database serves as a persistent store for **progress and inventory**, ensuring players can resume exactly where they left off.
- A **manual save system** which complements the auto-save feature:
  - Unsaved progress is temporarily cached and written to a local table.
  - When the player triggers a manual save, the cached data is committed to the database.
  - This guarantees consistency and prevents progress loss even if the player exits unexpectedly.

## Party System

		  ### Inspiration

    	The Party System was initially created to allow players to
    	play together in the same game instance. I developed the comprehensive party
    	system which allows players to invite friends from different servers to join
    	their game instance.

    	### How it works

    	The system communicates across servers
    	to send requests to other players using [MessagingService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MessagingService). Instead of waiting for an immediate
    	response, the game server efficiently listens for events on a designated
    	hook. This approach ensures that the server doesn't block the thread or
    	unnecessarily consume resources while awaiting a response.

## Custom Donation System

		  ### How it works

    	A Custom Donation System that lets players sponsor the developers with any amount of currency based on their preference. The system communicates to a Backend server which acts as a reverse proxy through `nginx`, hosted on **RaspberryPi** to create a new Developer Product.
    </GridItem>

</Grid>

### Why?

Roblox does not offer support inside its game engine for creating developer products. Originally the backend was written in Rust using my [roblox-api](https://github.com/royce-mathew/robloxapi) library.

Later, I realized that maintaining both, the rust package, and also working on the game would be hard. So I decided to switch to TypeScript instead and use the [noblox.js](https://noblox.js.org/) package.
