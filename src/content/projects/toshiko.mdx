This project was a **first-person survival horror game** developed in `Lua-U` on
the Roblox Engine. Inspired by classics such as _Resident Evil_ and _PT_, the
game focuses on atmosphere, tension, and engaging gameplay.

As the **sole programmer**, I collaborated closely with modelers, builders, and designers to bring the project to life. My role involved implementing the game&apos;s core systems, ensuring smooth mechanics, and creating an immersive horror experience. The game is currently in its final stages of development.

## Learning Experience

- Designed and implemented a **client-server architecture** to handle game logic and user interactions.
- Built a **responsive inventory system** with an intuitive graphical interface.
- Developed a **dynamic lighting system** to reinforce the eerie, horror-driven atmosphere.
- Created a **database system** to manage player data, progress, and user settings.
- Scripted **game events** to deliver challenging and unpredictable scenarios.

# Features

## Database and Inventory System

### How it works

The game includes a **dynamic database system** that tracks player progress, settings, and inventory. Data is saved automatically or manually, depending on user preference. The **inventory system** provides an interactive GUI, allowing players to manage and use items seamlessly within the game world.

### Internals

- As the player joins, the game checks for an existing database entry and loads the player's progress; new players are automatically assigned a new entry.
- The database serves as a persistent store for **progress and inventory**, ensuring players can resume exactly where they left off.
- A **manual save system** which complements the auto-save feature:
  - Unsaved progress is temporarily cached.
  - When the player triggers a manual save, the cached data is committed to the database.
  - This guarantees consistency and prevents progress loss even if the player exits unexpectedly.

## Party System

<Grid>
	
	<GridItem>
		<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold'>Inspiration</h3>

    	The Party System was initially created to allow players to
    	play together in the same game instance. I developed the comprehensive party
    	system which allows players to invite friends from different servers to join
    	their game instance.

    	<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>How it works</h3>

    	The system communicates across servers
    	to send requests to other players using [MessagingService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MessagingService). Instead of waiting for an immediate
    	response, the game server efficiently listens for events on a designated
    	hook. This approach ensures that the server doesn't block the thread or
    	unnecessarily consume resources while awaiting a response.

## Custom Donation System

	</GridItem>
	<GridItem>
		<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold'>How it works</h3>

    	The Custom Donation System lets players sponsor the developers with an amount based on their preference. The system communicates to a Backend server which acts as a reverse proxy through `nginx`, hosted on **RaspberryPi** to create a new Developer Product.

    	<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-6'>Why?</h3>

    	Roblox does not offer support inside its game engine for creating developer products. Originally the backend was written in Rust using my [roblox-api](https://github.com/royce-mathew/robloxapi) cargo crate.

    	Later, I realized that maintaining both, the rust package, and also working on the game would be hard. So I decided to switch to TypeScript instead and use the [noblox.js](https://noblox.js.org/) package.
