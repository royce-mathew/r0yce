# Overview

Kanjou is a realtime collaborative text editor which saves your data to firebase.

The app allows multiple users to edit documents in real-time. It also supports `syntax highlighting` for various programming languages.
Kanjou was inspired from Notion and Google Docs, and aims to provide a similar but better experience for users.

### Motivation

I have always been fascinated by realtime applications and wanted to build one myself. I was also in need of a note taking app for myself and thought of building one which can be used by multiple users at the same time.

I wanted to create the new document app in a format that I was comfortable with, which is markdown. I also wanted to add syntax highlighting to the app, so that users can write code snippets inside the app itself.

## Technologies

- 🖥️ **Next.js** for server-side rendering
- 🔥 **Firebase** for authentication and data storage
- 🛡️ **Authjs v5** for user authentication
- 📝 **Tiptap** for rich text editing

### Learning Experience

During the development of Kanjou, I learned how to use the Firebase SDK to work with user authentication and data storage. There were several struggles during the development of the app.

The initial struggle I faced was regarding authentication. I wanted to use Firebase for storing user sessions and also handle data. Since I was using the `next-auth` package, there was an available Firebase adapter for storing the user session.

## Workarounds

There were several roadblocks I faced during the development of Kanjou.

            Middleware Implementation
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            When using the firebase adapter, you cannot call the `auth()` method inside `middleware.ts`, instead you need to have a workaround. The `auth()` function currently does not work because of the `firebase-admin` package not being able to be used in the browser. The workaround is to use the `getToken` function from the `@auth/core/jwt` package.

            ```typescript {8-13} title="middleware.ts"
            import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"
            import { getToken } from "@auth/core/jwt"

            const secure = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"

            export default async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
                // Retrieve the user data from the JWT token
                const userData = await getToken({
                    secureCookie: secure,
                    req,
                    secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET ?? "",
                    salt: secure ? "__Secure-authjs.session-token" : "authjs.session-token",
                })
                const isLoggedIn = !!userData

                if (!isLoggedIn) {
                    // Redirect to login page if the user is not logged in
                    const { nextUrl } = req
                    let callbackUrl = nextUrl.pathname
                    if (nextUrl.search) {
                        callbackUrl += nextUrl.search
                    }

                    // Encode the callback URL to ensure proper redirection
                    const encodedCallbackUrl = encodeURIComponent(callbackUrl)
                    return NextResponse.redirect(
                        new URL(`/api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=${encodedCallbackUrl}`, req.url)
                    )
                }
            }
            ```

            Realtime Firebase Synchronization
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            For reading all documents, I had to use the `onSnapshot` method from the Firebase Client SDK. This method listens to changes in the document and updates the data in realtime. The `onSnapshot` method is used to listen to changes in the document and update the data in realtime.

            The real problem I faced was when I had to update the document in realtime. I had to use the `set` method from the Firebase Client SDK to update the document. Although there is no problem with the `set` method, the problem arises when multiple requests are being set everytime the user makes a change.

            This is because the `set` method overwrites the document with the new data, which can cause data loss if multiple users are editing the document at the same time.
