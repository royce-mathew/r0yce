# Overview

{/* [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/robloxapi.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/robloxapi) */}

## What is this?

RobloxApi is a rust library that wraps Roblox's web api endpoints into Rust compatible format and allows for cookie based authorization. The wrapper seamlessly integrates users, groups, games, and payment services into Rust-compatible formats for easy access and manipulation. This project originally started as a simple fork and grew to be something more with time.

## Use Case

This library is being used in a program being hosted on a RaspberryPi which listens for requests from Roblox servers and then creates a developer product based on the contents of the request.

Using this library, I was able to create the custom Donation System for [Toshiko - Tokyo Undying](/projects/toshiko)

## Implementations

- Complete Refactor of the original source code
- Added Error Handling for API Requests
- Changed how the Http client is used and accessed across functions
- Added compatibility for multiple Http clients to access different cookies

# Documentation

## Installation

You can install the library by running `cargo add robloxapi`

### Retrieving Users

Example of retrieving a given user, three different ways!

```rust showLineNumbers
use robloxapi;
use tokio;

// The cookie is needed for several api endpoints; Specifically those which interact with acccount / game data.
const COOKIE: &str = ""

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut client = rbxapi::Client::new(); // Create new client Instance
    client.set_cookie(COOKIE).await; // Set the cookie for the client instance

    // Example on getting users
    let my_user = client.current_user().await?; // Get the current user
    let str_user = client.user("builderman").await?; // Get user by username
    let int_user = client.user(156).await?; // Get user by userid
}
```

### Developer Products / Games

```rust showLineNumbers
use robloxapi;
use tokio;

const COOKIE: &str = ""

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
   let place_id = 7415484311; // Place ID for game
   let mut client = robloxapi::Client()::new(); // Create a new client instance
   client.set_cookie(COOKIE).await; // We need to set the cookie if we want to have permissions for creating developer products

   // Create a new game given place id
   let mut game = client.game(place_id).await?;

    // Returns a ApiResult which can be unwrapped to a value or a APIError
    let dev_product = game.create_dev_product(
        "name-of-dev-product", // Name of the developer product
        17 // Price of the developer product
    ).await?;
}

```
