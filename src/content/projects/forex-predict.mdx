# Overview

This page is a copy of the ipynb file being hosted on Github. Full research paper can be found [here](https://github.com/royce-mathew/ForexPredictor/blob/master/src/ForexPredictor.ipynb)

Predicting the forex market can be quite hard for a nerual network to understand due to the properties of the market. To get an accurate prediction, a neural network needs a very high number of parameters, a lot of data, and thousands of iterations of training.

This paper tries to explore the question on whether a neural network is able to accurately predict the foreign exchange market given a limited set of parameters.

The program works by using a neural networking algorithm known as **"NEAT"**. NEAT stands for **"Neural Networks through Augmented Topologies"**. The neat algorithm works by using the concept of life, where each generation starts to learn more based on the knowledge of the previous generation; The best scoring individual from this generation gets to reproduce and go onto the next generation.

A proper explanation on how the algorithm works can be found [here](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html/)

## Retrieving / Downloading Forex Charts

To start, we'll retrieve the data using a public module which imports data from yahoo.finance and automatically converts it into a csv file. This piece of code saves the data as a .csv file.

```python line-numbers
# Imports
from matplotlib import ticker
import yfinance as yf

# Variables
ticker_name: str = "JPY=X" # "JPY=X"


# Download ticker data
ticker_data = yf.download(
    tickers=ticker_name, # Set ticker as variable
    period="max", # Get as much data as possible
)

ticker_data.to_csv(f"./../assets/{ticker_name}.csv") # Save dataframe as a csv file

ticker_data # Display Ticker Data

```

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
