# Overview

This page is a copy of the ipynb file being hosted on Github. Full research paper can be found [here](https://github.com/royce-mathew/ForexPredictor/blob/master/src/ForexPredictor.ipynb)

Predicting the forex market can be quite hard for a nerual network to understand due to the properties of the market. To get an accurate prediction, a neural network needs a very high number of parameters, a lot of data, and thousands of iterations of training.

This paper tries to explore the question on whether a neural network is able to accurately predict the foreign exchange market given a limited set of parameters.

The program works by using a neural networking algorithm known as **"NEAT"**. NEAT stands for **"Neural Networks through Augmented Topologies"**. The neat algorithm works by using the concept of life, where each generation starts to learn more based on the knowledge of the previous generation; The best scoring individual from this generation gets to reproduce and go onto the next generation.

A proper explanation on how the algorithm works can be found [here](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html/)

## Retrieving / Downloading Forex Charts

To start, we'll retrieve the data using a public module which imports data from yahoo.finance and automatically converts it into a csv file. This piece of code saves the data as a .csv file.

```python showLineNumbers
# Imports
from matplotlib import ticker
import yfinance as yf

# Variables
ticker_name: str = "JPY=X" # "JPY=X"


# Download ticker data
ticker_data = yf.download(
    tickers=ticker_name, # Set ticker as variable
    period="max", # Get as much data as possible
)

ticker_data.to_csv(f"./../assets/{ticker_name}.csv") # Save dataframe as a csv file

ticker_data # Display Ticker Data
```

### Retrieving the dataset used

To retrieve the data, we'll use pandas to pull the file from the github repository. Pandas automatically takes care of making the web request.

```python showLineNumbers
import pandas as pd
import http.client as client # Need to read text file

# Use links to store data
assets_path: str = "https://github.com/royce-mathew/data/raw/master"

# Pandas automatically makes the request
ticker_data: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_csv(f"{assets_path}/JPY=X.csv", index_col=0)
```

### Plotting Initial Data

To plot the initial data, pandas.plot is used. Pandas.plot internally uses matplotlib to plot data.

This plot displays the adjusted close price for each 24 hour period.

```python showLineNumbers
# Plot the data
ticker_data.index = pd.to_datetime(ticker_data.index) # Convert the index to a datetime value
ticker_data.plot.line(y="Adj Close", use_index=True)
```

# Data Analysis

To use NEAT, we need to convert the ticker data and optimize the parameters we pass to it.

We need to show the algorithm some trends in the data so it is able to learn patterns, so we pass the algorithm:

- RSI: Relative strength index
- EMA: Exponential moving averages
- Close Ratios: The ratio of the current close by the rolling averages of the past closes
- Trend Horizons: Current trend of profits / losses

After filling the dataset with all these values, the program minmaxes all the values to be between 0 and 1, generally considered good practise for inputs in machine learning.

```python showLineNumbers

import pandas_ta as ta # We use pandas_ta to see trends in the ticker data
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler # Used to scale values between 0 and 1

# Insert new rows to the ticker data using pandas_ta
"""
	RSI tells us overbought / oversold conditions in the market
	EMAF tells us the exponential moving average

	The rolling averages will tell us whether the market has gone up or down
"""
horizons: list[int] = [2, 5, 60, 250, 1000] # The mean closing prices we'll use; 2days, 5days, ...

def convert_dataframe(dataframe) -> pd.DataFrame:
	dataframe.reset_index(inplace=True) # Reset index of dataframe, this gives us an index of integers instead of Dates
	dataframe.drop(["Volume", "Close", "Date", "High", "Low"], axis=1, inplace=True) # Drop unneeded columns


	# Create new rows to see target value for tomorrow; this is used to train the model
	dataframe["Target"] = dataframe["Adj Close"] - dataframe["Open"] # Calculate whether the value increased or decreased
	dataframe["Target"] = dataframe["Target"].shift(-1) # Shift the target by - 1 so we know tomorrow's target
	dataframe["TargetClass"] = (dataframe["Target"] > 0).astype(int) # Classify buy/sell

	dataframe["RSI"] = ta.rsi(dataframe["Adj Close"], length=15)
	dataframe["EMAM"] = ta.ema(dataframe["Adj Close"], length=100)
	dataframe["EMAF"] = ta.ema(dataframe["Adj Close"], length=20)
	dataframe["EMAS"] = ta.ema(dataframe["Adj Close"], length=150)

	for horizon in horizons: # Loop through these closing prices and add them as a column
		rolling_averages: pd.DataFrame = dataframe.rolling(horizon).mean()

		# Add to the dataframe
		ratio_column: str = f"Close Ratio {horizon}"
		dataframe[ratio_column] = dataframe["Adj Close"] / rolling_averages["Adj Close"]

		trend_column: str = f"Trend {horizon}"
		dataframe[trend_column] = dataframe.shift(1).rolling(horizon).sum()["TargetClass"]


	# Drop Missing Values
	dataframe.dropna(inplace=True)
	dataframe.reset_index(inplace=True) # Reset index again because we dropped null values
	dataframe.drop(["index"], axis=1, inplace=True)

	scaled_data: pd.DataFrame = dataframe.copy(deep=True) # Deep Copy
	# Only give the model values it will know in the real world
	scaled_data.drop(["Open", "Target", "TargetClass"], axis=1, inplace=True)
	# Optimize data range between 0 to 1 for the model
	scaled_data = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1)).fit_transform(scaled_data)

	return scaled_data



scaled_data = convert_dataframe(ticker_data) # Convert dataframe with important values
```

## Plotting Input Data

Plot the important inputs that are passed to the neural network. The following function plots:

- Adj Close
- EMA: Exponential Moving Average
- RSI: Relative Strength Index

The input data that are passed to the neural network should help it approximate whether the next time period's closing value will be higher / lower compared to the current close.

```python showLineNumbers

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def input_plot():
	index = range(len(scaled_data))

	# Plot values
	plt.plot(index, ticker_data["Adj Close"], 'r', label="Adj Close")
	plt.plot(index, ticker_data["EMAM"], 'g', label="EMAM")
	plt.plot(index, ticker_data["EMAF"], 'b', label="EMAF")
	plt.title("Input Data")
	plt.xlabel("Index")
	plt.ylabel("Parameters")
	plt.grid()
	plt.legend(loc="best")
	plt.show()


	plt.figure()
	plt.plot(index, ticker_data["RSI"], 'r', label="RSI", alpha=0.7)



	# Add Labels
	plt.title("Input Data")
	plt.xlabel("Index")
	plt.ylabel("Parameters")
	plt.grid()
	plt.legend(loc="best")
	plt.show()

input_plot() # Plot the inputs
```

## Plotting the Statistics of Neural Network

To plot the statistics of the neural network, matplotlib is used while the neat module gives us most of the info needed to create the charts.

This plot displasy the fitness of each each generation. The fitness attribute is given to a genome when it starts making profits by predicting the outcome of the future closes.

```python showLineNumbers

%matplotlib inline

# Plotting the statistics
def plot_statistics(stats):
    generation = range(len(stats.most_fit_genomes))
    best_fitness = [c.fitness for c in stats.most_fit_genomes] # Get best fitnessses in each generation
    avg_fitness = np.array(stats.get_fitness_mean()) # Get the average fitness of the generation
    stdev_fitness = np.array(stats.get_fitness_stdev()) # Ge the standard deviation of the fitness

    # Plot values
    plt.plot(generation, avg_fitness, 'b-', label="average")
    plt.plot(generation, avg_fitness - stdev_fitness, 'g-.', label="-1 std", alpha=0.5)
    plt.plot(generation, avg_fitness + stdev_fitness, 'g-.', label="+1 std", alpha=0.5)
    plt.plot(generation, best_fitness, 'r-', label="best")

    # Add Labels
    plt.title("Profits vs Generation")
    plt.xlabel("Generations")
    plt.ylabel("Profits")
    plt.grid()
    plt.legend(loc="best")
    plt.show()

```

## Training the Model

The model is trained using the intial data that was was declared as a dataframe.

The training works by essentially telling the giving the genome today's close and rewarding it fitness based on the prediction it makes.

The genome is passed all the values in the scaled_data dataframe with the state that it is currently in. The genome gains a very small amount of fitness for holding onto a trade while the value of that trade increases.

There are 3 outputs that the genome gives:

- Index 0: represents a hold state
- Index 1: represents a buy state
- Index 2: represents a sell state

The genome is not allowed to gain negative profits and is removed from the population if it starts gaining negative profits.

```python showLineNumbers
%matplotlib inline

## Testing

The best genome can be tested on the decisions it chooses each day.

```python showLineNumbers
index: int = 222 # Index to start testing from
test_data_len: int = 500 # Number of days to test
total_profit: float = 0 # The profit the genome has made

test_scaled: pd.DataFrame = convert_dataframe(test_data) # Convert dataframe so we can send it to the model
genome_money: Forex = Forex() # Initialize a new object to hold profit statistics for current genome
decision_counter: list[int] = [0, 0, 0]
decisions: list[str] = ["Hold", "Buy", "Sell"]


# Test a specific genome
def test_genome(genome=None, process_data=None) -> int:

        raise Exception("Error, process data is needed.")

    if genome is None: # If genome isn't passed, use the best.pickle
        try:  # Catch any errors when trying to open the best.pickle file

                genome_money.buy(current_close) # Buy a new stock

        case 2: # Sell
            total_profit += genome_money.sell(current_close) # Sell the stock

```

# Final Remarks

## Discussion

As the data shows, during learning, the genome's profits stay erratic between each generation and do not increase at a linear rate. To create a more efficient algorithm, the data that is passed to the neat algorithm would need to be more correlational for the algorithm to start to see patterns in data. More computing power and more iterations of generations are needed to see progress in profits.

During testing, the best genome in all 200 generations is not able to create a profit at all with a new and different dataset. As displayed by the bar graph shown above, the neural network decides to mostly make hold decisions because it thinks that the longest way to survive is by holding. The neural network also decides to buy approximately 2 times but never decides to close the trade which leaves it at always a negative profit. One reason that the neural network decides to always hold the trade is possibly because it gains some fitness when the value of the currency goes up and it sees selling as too much of a risky decision.

All in all, the current neat algorithm, although efficient, is not smart enough to predict Forex Charts based on pure trends in the data and only 200 iterations of generations.
