# Overview

## What is EasyConnect?

Easy Connect is a remote desktop control application that lets you control your desktop using your phone. Our project provides a convenient and efficient way for you to manage your desktop. Created in 24 hours during a Hackathon for [Hackville 2023](https://hackville2023.devpost.com/) . Check out the [Easy Connect's Devpost Page](https://devpost.com/software/easyconnect/).

## The Idea

We believe our project will provide a valuable solution to individuals who are inexperienced with technology. People who are inexperienced with technology generally have a harder time working on their desktop compared to their mobile phones. We are confident that our application will provide a smooth and seamless user experience.

## How it works

The application offers a mobile interface and a desktop program which lets you connect to your desktop. Once the desktop program is opened, it shows a unique code which can be entered into the mobile application to connect to the Desktop. The program works over local IP which prevents outsider access to the desktop.

Once connected, the user can control the desktop using the mobile; The application is developed in a way such that it is very easy to attach and create new modules / commands for communication between the Desktop.
