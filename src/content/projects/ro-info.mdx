# Overview

This Python-based application enhances data analysis workflows for Twitter accounts that analyze Roblox player information. Its primary functions include:

- Rapid Data Retrieval: Employs scraping techniques against the roblox.com website to efficiently gather player information.
- API Integration: Leverages API endpoints to access and consolidate user data.
- User Ranking: Applies ranking algorithms to provided user information, generating insights for data analysis.

## Motivation

The project aims to streamline a laborious, week-long process of manually retrieving player data for Twitter analysis accounts. This automation significantly reduces the task's time requirement to merely 5 minutes.

## Key Features

- Rate Limit Mitigation: Strategically utilizes proxies to circumvent rate limitations, enabling high-speed data scraping.
- Optimized Performance: Leverages multithreading to maximize data retrieval efficiency, sending requests concurrently across different threads.

## Benefits

By using this application, Twitter accounts specializing in Roblox data analysis experienced:

- Substantial Time Savings: Drastic reduction in data retrieval time.
- Increased Productivity: Enables analysts to focus on core analysis tasks rather than manual data collection.
- Scalability: Potential to handle larger data sets and more complex ranking systems.
