## Key Features

- Rate Limit Mitigation: Strategically utilizes proxies to circumvent rate limitations, enabling high-speed data scraping.
- Optimized Performance: Leverages multithreading to maximize data retrieval efficiency, sending requests concurrently across different threads.

## Benefits

By using this application, Twitter accounts specializing in Roblox data analysis experienced:

- Substantial Time Savings: Drastic reduction in data retrieval time.
- Increased Productivity: Enables analysts to focus on core analysis tasks rather than manual data collection.
- Scalability: Potential to handle larger data sets and more complex ranking systems.
