Ensure you have [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Installed.

Ensure you have [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) Installed and
on your Path.

Navigate to the folder where the bot is located and run the following command in
your terminal of choice.

Installing Pip: `python3 -m pip install`

```console
python3 setup.py
```

After running the command, setup will ask you to create a `.env` file. <br/>
This file is where _DISCORD_TOKEN_ is stored. Your discord app token can be
